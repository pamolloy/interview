A cat is stuck in a maze, which is represented by a two-dimensional array of characters. In the array a `G` represents ground, `W` is a wall, `C` is the cat and `X` is the exit.

```
GGGCGG
GGWWWG
GGGWWX
GGGWGG
```

Find the length of the shortest path between the cat and the exit.

Problem from an interview at a large technology company.
