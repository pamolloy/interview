Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list
weighted by their depth. For example, given the list `{{1, 1}, 2, {1, 1}}` the
function should return 10 (i.e. four 1's at depth 2, and one 2 at depth 1). 
Similarily, the list `{1, {4, {6}}}` should return 27 (i.e. one 1 at depth 1,
one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3).
